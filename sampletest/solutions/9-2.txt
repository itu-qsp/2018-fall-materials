quadratic

Explanation:
Worst-case scenario is that the longest word is in the end
of the list. Since we have two for-loops that means that
every time we hit one element in the outer loop, we will
go through the inner loop (the entire list).
So worst-case we will go through all the elements in the
inner loop (n elements) and all the elements in the outer
loop (n elements times n elements) before we found the
largest element. In total that is n*n or n^2 or quadratic.
