# The function takes a list.
# It iterates through the list.
# If the value it is currently at is greater than the next value
# they get swapped. 
# It repeats but without looking at the last element of the intermediate
# list (because the greatest element goes to the end). 
# So it sorts the list from smallest to greatest. 

# 2. The runtime complexity of the algorithm is quadratic. 
# The runtime is n*0.5n = 0.5n^2 which is O(n^2)
